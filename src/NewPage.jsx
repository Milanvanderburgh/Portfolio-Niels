              <p>
              My name is Niels Jansen, a 21-year-old Software Development student from Zeeland. Coding has always been a passion of mine, and Iâ€™m dedicated to becoming a skilled developer capable of building innovative solutions and creating tools that meet my needs.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Outside of my studies, I enjoy gaming, watching films, spending time with friends, and going on long walks with my dog. Gaming sharpens my problem-solving and strategic thinking, while watching films allows me to unwind and enjoy creative storytelling. Socializing at parties with friends helps me create lasting memories, and walking with my dog offers a great way to clear my mind and find inspiration.
                <br></br><br></br>
                I believe that maintaining a balance between work and relaxation is essential for personal growth. I thrive in collaborative environments, love taking on new challenges, and am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and develop my skills. My dedication to both my hobbies and professional goals motivates me to push boundaries. I hope to use my technical expertise and creativity to make a positive difference in the world of software development.</p>
